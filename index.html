            <h2>About the Gas Fee Refund Process</h2>
            <p>The gas fee refund process is designed to return unused or excess gas fees that were not utilized during a transaction on the Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain networks. Here's how it works:</p>

            <h3>What Are Gas Fees?</h3>
            <p>Gas fees are payments made by users to compensate for the computing energy required to process transactions on the Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain networks. The fee is typically a small amount of cryptocurrency, paid in ETH (Ethereum) or BNB (Binance Coin), and is used to pay miners for including your transaction in the blockchain.</p>

            <h3>Why Do Refunds Happen?</h3>
            <p>In some cases, a transaction may use less gas than was originally estimated. This can occur for several reasons, including network congestion or changes in transaction complexity. When this happens, the excess gas fees can be refunded back to the user.</p>

            <h3>How to Claim Your Refund</h3>
            <p>To claim your gas fee refund, simply enter your Ethereum or BNB address in the text box above and click "Claim Refund." Our system will check for any available refunds associated with your address and guide you through the process of reclaiming your funds.</p>

            <h3>Important Notes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refunds are only available for transactions where excess gas fees were not utilized.</li>
                <li>The refund process may take some time depending on network conditions.</li>
                <li>Ensure that you are connected to a supported wallet to claim your refund.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you have any questions about the refund process, please contact our support team for assistance.</p>
